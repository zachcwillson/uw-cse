Homework 2

Problem 1:

To start, from my home directory I made a new empty directory called hw2 (mkdir hw2)
I then entered that directory and started work (cd hw2).

My first command was the following: echo tweet > tweet && echo tweet
The part before && wrote the string 'tweet' to the file tweet, and then the part after && printed 'tweet' to standard out (terminal).

I then wrote the following command: cat tweet
The output of the file tweet got printed to standard out (terminal), which was the word 'tweet'.

I then ran: ls
This printed out all the items in the current directory. Because I was in hw2 which just contained the file tweet, that was the only thing printed to standard out (terminal).

To use the grep commmand and get tweet out, I ran: grep -E 'tweet' tweet, which searched the file tweet for the word 'tweet', and printed to standard out the one occurance.

The !! command just runs whatever was the last command, so right after my grep command, entering !! will also print the word 'tweet' to the console.
