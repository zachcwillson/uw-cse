README File

This readme file is supposed to have the parts I am most happy with, and the parts I am least confident in.

The Good:

    I like my solution to print out the first word. Its not the correct solution, but I went through about 6 complete re-writes of that method.
    
The Bad:

    This homework was not my best work, and this past week I did not use good time management skills (hence why I am turning it in one day late). I also missed class on various days (I do really like lecture so I am sorry I missed).
My solution has about 4 or 5 bugs when printing, and only prints the first word, or sometimes displays incorrect output..
