Q1. It looks lke the produce-scatterplot script makes a graph with x and y lables, then plots the results to the file.

Q2. Based on my scatterplot, it seems that, while there are some outliers, a website with a smaller rank (more popular) also has a smaller index page size. I expected this, as people tend to avoid overwhelming sites with a lot of stimulation.
