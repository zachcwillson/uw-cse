Homework 6 - Due 3/9/17

1. Using Quick Sort, with the median pivot rule (pick the median of: data[lo],
   data[hi - 1], and data[(hi + lo) / 2]), sort the following list of numbers.
   Show your work by drawing the tree of partitions and pivots
   (as seen in the lecture slides) with the partition rules discussed in lecture
   (swapping the pivot to index lo and doing swaps to complete the partitions).
   Apply a cutoff of 3 elements and sort with any sorting method. 
   data= [5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 2]
   
   Answer:

2. Using Radix Sort with a radix of 6 (letters: a, b, c, d, e, f) to alphabetically
   sort the following strings, draw contents of each bucket at the end of each radix
   'digit' iteration pass.
   Strings = (abc, da, ffff, defcd, abebd, ca, b, fef, dfe)
   
   Answer:
   
3. If you did any above and beyond for extra credit, describe what you did.
   
   Answer: To go above and beyond, I made a GereicSorter<E> class. I then
           copied my methods from PacketSorter, and did a find-replace for 'Packet'
           to E. The only other change I had to make was on line 52 of GenericSorter
           because it wouldn't let me create a new array of type E. Thank you for 
           the most fun cse class I have taken so far!!! :)
